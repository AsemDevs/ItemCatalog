## Steps to run this project

1. Download and install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).

2. Download and install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

3. Clone or download the Vagrant VM configuration file from [here](https://github.com/udacity/fullstack-nanodegree-vm).

4. Open the above directory and navigate to the `vagrant/` sub-directory.

5. Open terminal, and type

   ```bash
   vagrant up
   ```

   This will cause Vagrant to download the Ubuntu operating system and install it. This may take quite a while depending on how fast your Internet connection is.

6. After the above command succeeds, connect to the newly created VM:

   ```bash
   vagrant ssh
   ```

8.Type `cd /vagrant/` to navigate to the shared repository.

9.Download or clone this repository, and navigate to it.

11.Install or upgrade Flask:

```bash
    sudo python3 -m pip install --upgrade flask
```

12.Set up the database:

```bash
    python3 database_setup.py
```

13.Insert dummy values. **If you don't run this, the application might not run.**

```bash
    python3 somecities.py
```

14.Run this application:

```bash
    python3 application.py
```

15.Open `http://localhost:7000/` in your favourite Web browser, and enjoy.

## Debugging

In case the app doesn't run, make sure to confirm the following points:

- You have run `python3 somecities.py` before running the application. This is an essential step.
- The latest version of Flask is installed.
- Python 3.6 is installed. In the vagrant machine, you may find Python 3.5 installed by default. To install Python 3.7, follow [this answer](https://askubuntu.com/a/865569/571299). To invoke Python 3.6, type `python3.7` instead of `python3`.

## Known Issue

This app might show an empty username if you sign in with a custom-domain-based Google account (Corporate accounts). For instance, if you use a Google account `johndoe@company.com`, this app might show an empty username.

## Help and Support
